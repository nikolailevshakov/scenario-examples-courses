FROM golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum .
RUN go mod download
COPY . .

FROM base AS build-client
RUN go build -o /bin/client ./cmd/client

FROM base AS build-server
RUN go build -o /bin/server ./cmd/server

FROM scratch AS client
COPY --from=build-client /bin/client /bin/
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/client" ]

FROM scratch AS server
COPY --from=build-server /bin/server /bin/
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/server" ]

FROM scratch AS binaries
COPY --from=server /bin/server /
COPY --from=client /bit/client /
```{{copy}}
