Separate build stage and create image only with the resulted binary.
Compare the size of the images `server-1` and `server-2`.
Use `scratch` as a base image for the runnable image.

<br>

<br>

Modify `/root/app/Dockerfile`:

<br>

```plain
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM golang:1.21-alpine
WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum .
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /bin/client ./cmd/client
RUN go build -o /bin/server ./cmd/server
# as it is just a build step, we don't need CMD or ENTRYPOINT command

FROM scratch # minimal base image
COPY --from=0 /bin/server /bin/ # copy /bin/server file from the previously build image (0 as we didn't name it)
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/server" ]
```

<br>

Build the image:

<br>

```plain
docker build -t server-2 .

docker image ls
```{{exec}}
