<details><summary>Tip</summary>
<br>

```plain
Build arguments is a great way to add flexibility to your builds. 
You can pass build arguments at build-time, and you can set a default value that the builder uses as a fallback.

You can also inject values inside your code, but the way it's done is different for every language.

WORKDIR /src
COPY go.mod go.sum .
RUN go mod download
COPY . .

FROM base AS build-client
RUN go build -o /bin/client ./cmd/client

FROM base AS build-server
RUN go build -o /bin/server ./cmd/server

FROM scratch AS client
COPY --from=build-client /bin/client /bin/
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/client" ]

FROM scratch AS server
