You can use `ADD` and `COPY` to perform the same action: copy a file.
However, it is recomended to use only `COPY` for that.
Modify existed  `/root/Dockerfile`:
- copy file `copy_file.txt` with keyword `COPY`
- copy file `add_file.txt` with keywork `ADD`
- build image `app-image`, confirm that files were copied to the container
